To Do: 
- Implement a 100 neurons recurrently connected, rate-based point neuron models. 
- Connections are plastic under standard BCM learning rule. 
- Form 5 subgroups of 20 neurons, each of the subgroup gets correlated inputs.
- Study under which conditions neurons within the subgroups form strong bidirectional connections. 
- Fix the connections. Study the functional implications of this clustered connectivity pattern compared to a random connectivity pattern. What is it good for? Maybe the first thing to test is improvement in signal/to/noise, robustness etc.
